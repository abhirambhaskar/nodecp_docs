# NodeCP Installation Guide

This guide walks you through the process of installing **NodeCP Control Panel** on your server via SSH.

## VPS Configuration (Before Installation)

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure your VPS meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 22 (Recommended), Ubuntu 18/23 (Supported)
- **Minimum RAM:** 2GB (4GB Recommended)
- **Disk Space:** 15GB minimum
- **Root Access:** Required
- **DNS Configuration:** Ensure your domain/subdomain A record points to your server's IP
- **Optional:** Port 25 enabled for email functionality

## Installation Methods

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install with GUI (Recommended)
If you want a **graphical interface** for setup, use the following command:

```bash
curl -o bash.sh https://cdn.nodecp.com/bash.sh && chmod +x bash.sh && ./bash.sh
```

This script downloads and executes the **NodeCP installation script** with an interactive **GUI prompt**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Without GUI (Direct Setup)
For a **direct installation (non-GUI method)** with a predefined domain, use:

```bash
curl -o domainbash.sh https://cdn.nodecp.com/domainbash.sh && chmod +x domainbash.sh && ./domainbash.sh -hostdomain panel.example.com
```

Replace `panel.example.com` with your **actual domain/subdomain** before running the command.

## Configuration During Installation

### 1. Configure Domain Information

After starting the installation, you will be prompted to enter the main domain for NodeCP:

### 2. Wait for Installation to Complete

The installation process may take several minutes.

## üöÄ Automate VPS Setup with Cloud-Init

When creating a server, you can use **cloud-init** to automatically configure your server.  
Copy and paste this Cloud-Init script during server deployment:

```yaml
#cloud-config
package_update: true
package_upgrade: true

runcmd:
  - curl -o domainbash.sh https://cdn.nodecp.com/domainbash.sh && chmod +x domainbash.sh && ./domainbash.sh -hostdomain panel.example.com

write_files:
  - path: /etc/motd
    content: |
      Welcome to your NodeCP powered server!
      Access your panel at: https://panel.example.com/nodecpspace

users:
  - name: admin
    sudo: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
    shell: /bin/bash
    ssh-authorized-keys:
      - your-ssh-public-key-here

final_message: "NodeCP installation is complete. Access your panel at: https://panel.example.com/nodecpspace"

```

### **How to Use This Script**
- **Copy & paste** this script when creating a VPS.
- It **automatically installs NodeCP** during the first boot.
- Replace `your-ssh-public-key-here` with your **SSH key**.

## Important Notes

- **Ensure correct DNS settings** before starting the installation.
- The **GUI method** is easier for beginners, while the **Direct method** is for advanced users.
- **NodeCP provides complete hosting management tools** including File Manager, SSL, Email, and Database control.
